# ESP Features

**ESP** is a thoroughly modern HTML5 Web application built on the [Meteor][meteor] application
framework and the [Atlas-Cesium][atlas] rendering engine. This means ESP can deliver the
capabilities of a high-performance 3D GIS tool in the browser in real time, with no installation.

* Interactive 3D volumetric rendering, provided by [Atlas-Cesium][atlas]
* Interactive lists of editable [typologies, lots and entities](analysis.md)
* Support for importing common GIS formats, including ESRI Shapefiles, GeoJSON, KML and KMZ
* Data management and security through authorised project access structure
* Report dashboard populated with results of automatic context-sensitive analyses

To see these features in action, follow the [Maroondah demonstrator site
walkthrough](walkthrough.md).
